Data cleaning, Preprocessing and Insight

The purpose of my research is to analyze the review of software products on Amazon and gain insight to evaluate the accuracy and understandability of detecting false reviews of software products on Amazon. My goal is to gain an understanding of why reviews are made in a specific way and the associated cause or level of bias in a review.
•	Extract the data from reviews of software products for data cleaning and preprocessing.
•	Transform these preprocessed data into meaningful data frames for visualization.
•	Compare these visuals for insights and clarification.
